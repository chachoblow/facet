# Facet — Handoff Notes

A pickup point for the next working session. Read this first, then dive into the docs it references.

## Where things stand

- **Project**: Facet — a markdown editing experience oriented around shared alignment across humans, AI agents, and future-self.
- **V1 target**: Facet for VS Code, a Hybrid live-preview Surface for `.md` files, built on CodeMirror 6.
- **Long-term vision**: Three Surfaces (Facet for VS Code, Facet Review, Facet Studio) sharing a Remark-based markdown core, with the git repo as the Content source of truth.
- **Repo**: <https://github.com/chachoblow/facet> — public, `main` branch.
- **Status**: Monorepo scaffolded (pnpm workspaces + TypeScript project references + esbuild, Node 24 / pnpm 10 pinned). Spikes 1–3 run; all green-lit Plan A. Spike 1 promoted to a permanent test at `packages/core/test/round-trip.test.ts`. The VS Code extension builds and loads but only registers a stub `Facet: Hello` command — the real `CustomTextEditorProvider` + webview wiring is the next step.

## Read these first (in order)

1. [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) — setup, commands, and the read-first list mirrored from this file.
2. [`docs/facet-vision.md`](docs/facet-vision.md) — what Facet is for. Check feature ideas against the "Convergence of understanding" articulation.
3. [`docs/facet-spec-v1.md`](docs/facet-spec-v1.md) — v1 scope for Facet for VS Code. Includes explicit non-goals; respect them.
4. [`docs/facet-decisions.md`](docs/facet-decisions.md) — decision log with revisit conditions. Don't relitigate without checking the "When to revisit" criteria.
5. [`docs/UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`](docs/UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md) — canonical glossary. Use these terms in code, comments, commits, and prose.
6. [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — guardrails for code changes (applies to humans too).

Spike conclusions are in each `spikes/*/README.md` if you need them.

## Immediate next action: impl order step 1

The first end-to-end thread: CodeMirror 6 inside the `CustomTextEditorProvider`, writing the buffer verbatim on save. This is the production embodiment of D5 (round-trip fidelity).

Concretely:

1. Lift Spike 3's `CustomTextEditorProvider` plumbing into `apps/vscode/src/`. Add `contributes.customEditors` to the manifest. Drop the stub `Facet: Hello` command.
2. Add a webview entry (e.g. `apps/vscode/src/webview/main.ts`), bundled by a second esbuild target (`format: "iife"`, `platform: "browser"`).
3. Drop CodeMirror 6 into the webview. No Hybrid live-preview yet — plain editing of the buffer.
4. Wire the message loop: webview edit → host `WorkspaceEdit` writing verbatim bytes. This is the structural D5 mechanism.
5. CSP, `asWebviewUri()` for local assets, theme inheritance — all per Spike 3's findings.

Demonstrable end-to-end before moving on.

## Implementation order (ahead)

After step 1, in order:

2. Remark integration for AST awareness — parse only; no `remark-stringify` in the save path.
3. Hybrid live-preview for inline marks (bold, italic, links).
4. Hybrid live-preview for blocks (headings, lists, blockquotes, code).
5. Tables, task lists.
6. Frontmatter (collapsed block, click to expand).
7. Code block syntax highlighting.
8. Images (local via `asWebviewUri()`, remote direct).
9. Internal link navigation (including anchor links).
10. Mermaid (lazy-loaded, debounced, VS Code theme-mapped).
11. Theme integration (light, dark, high-contrast).
12. Activation command (`"Facet: Set as default markdown editor"`) + "View source" escape hatch.
13. Polish: cursor behavior edge cases, large-file performance.

Each step delivers something demonstrable end-to-end. Acceptance criteria are at the bottom of [`docs/facet-spec-v1.md`](docs/facet-spec-v1.md). Honest test: **point Facet for VS Code at the team's wiki repo and live on it for a week.**

## Pending / parked

- **Auth setup detail**: `gh auth setup-git` was run on the dev machine to make git use the active `gh` account. Switching `gh` accounts now affects which identity pushes to github.com. Switch back to `cpr-wklein` when working on other repos: `gh auth switch --user cpr-wklein`.
- **Commit author email**: Currently using `chachoblow@users.noreply.github.com`. The user has chosen not to attach a real email to Facet commits.
- **Open questions for the future** (not v1): Listed at the bottom of [`docs/facet-decisions.md`](docs/facet-decisions.md) — auth, hosting, real-time vs async, Frontmatter properties panel, paste-image, Mermaid PNG export.

## Guardrails for the next session

A few things easy to forget under time pressure:

- **Round-trip fidelity (D5).** The v1 mechanism is structural: CodeMirror owns the text buffer and saves write its bytes verbatim — `remark-stringify` is not called on the save path. Don't add a save-path serializer. Don't let CodeMirror, Remark config, or any plugin silently normalize list markers, reflow paragraphs, or rewrite link forms. The round-trip test at `packages/core/test/round-trip.test.ts` locks Remark behavior — keep it green and don't disable it. `remark-stringify` is a `devDependency` of `@facet/core` for the test only; don't promote it to `dependencies` or import it from `src/`.
- **No custom markdown syntax (D6).** CommonMark + GFM only. No wiki-style `[[links]]`, custom callouts, or embed syntax.
- **Use the canonical terms** from `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`. Especially **Surface** vs **Facet** and **Thread** vs **Comment**.
- **Plan B is real (D3).** If CodeMirror Hybrid live-preview turns into disproportionate custom-plugin work, switching Facet for VS Code to **Milkdown with a source-mode toggle** is a legitimate move, not a failure. Keep `packages/core/` library-agnostic so the swap stays feasible.
